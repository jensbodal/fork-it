## INGREDIENTS

1 tablespoon **canola oil**  
1/2 **onion**, diced  
2 stalks **celery**, diced  
1 **carrot**, peeled and diced  
2 cloves **garlic**, chopped  
1 teaspoon dried **oregano**  
1 teaspoon dried **marjoram**

## DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 350° F. Lightly grease a loaf pan.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions, celery and carrots until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, marjoram and fennel seeds; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.

Combine vegetable mixture, ground turkey, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan and gently press mixture down to pack; spoon marinara sauce over the top.

Bake until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads 165° F, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
