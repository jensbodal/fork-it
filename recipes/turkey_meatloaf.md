## INGREDIENTS

1 tablespoon **canola oil**<br>
1/2 **onion**, diced<br>
2 stalks **celery**, diced<br>
1 **carrot**, peeled and diced<br>
2 cloves **garlic**, chopped<br>
1 teaspoon dried **oregano**<br> 
1 teaspoon dried **marjoram**<br>
1/2 teaspoon **fennel seeds**<br>
2 pounds **ground dark turkey**<br>

3 splashes **fish sauce**<br>
**Salt and pepper**, to taste<br>
1/2 cup [**prepared marinara sauce**](./marinara_sauce.md)<br>

## DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 350° F. Lightly grease a loaf pan.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook onions, celery and carrots until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, oregano, marjoram and fennel seeds; cook until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.

Combine vegetable mixture, ground turkey, breadcrumbs, eggs, Worcestershire, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Transfer to the prepared loaf pan and gently press mixture down to pack; spoon marinara sauce over the top.

Bake until a thermometer inserted into the center of the meatloaf reads 165° F, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and let cool 10 to 15 minutes before serving.
