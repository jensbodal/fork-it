**Prep** 
4.00 lbs Russet Potatoes (peeled, 1" chunks)
8.00 cup water (2 quarts)
2.00 tablespoons sugar
2.00 tablespoons kosher salt
2.00 tablespoons vinegar



**Salad**
3.00 ribs celery (finely diced), you might want more or less celery for texture/flavor
0.50 cup red onion (finely diced)
0.50 cup scallions (finely diced)
0.25 cup parsley (finely chopped)
0.25 cup pickles (finely diced)
0.25 cup dill (finely chopped)
0.25 cup chopped bacon (optional, I use fresh bacon bits from store)

**Dressing (French)**
2.00 tbsp mustard
1.00 cups mayonnaise 
fresh ground pepper 

**Dressing (German)**
0.25 cup olive oil
2.00 tbsp vinegar 
2.00 tbsp mustard
1.00 small shallot
3.00 Garlic Cloves (can cook these in the potato water)
0.25 cup cooking water
fresh ground pepper

## Directions

**Potatoes** 

Cut potatoes into 1" chunks.
In large pot, mix water, salt, sugar, and vinegar; add potatoes. 
Set on high heat until boiling, then reduce to simmer, start stopwatch. 
Check doneness after 5 minutes, likely done by 10 minutes. 
Save 0.25 cup of the cooking water if making the german-style salad.

Once done place potatoes on rimmed baking sheet, spritz with apple cider vinegar (use 1:1 solution with water).  
Let cool 30 minutes or leave in fridge until ready to make the potato salad.

**Salad**

*Omit dill & pickles, and mayo if those aren't your thing.*

Make dressing first, then mix in salad ingredients, then fold in potatoes.  

Add more chopped herbs such as other types of parsley (chervil/italian) if you like. 

Add eggs last and garnish with herbs.  

You typically don't need to add salt due to the pickles, mustard and bacon, but taste it first and add more salt and pepper as needed.
